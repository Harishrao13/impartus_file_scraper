# Impartus File Scraper
Python script to scrape auto-generated lecture slides from impartus

Had to submit in a fuss for crux inductions!

Need to add couples of things(enhancements):
1.creds.txt file to store credentials
2.Avoid non-lectures(creates a empty pdf file when not found)
3.Need to add pdfs to a new/existing folder
